How many years have we been eating bananas and peeling them incorrectly?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,680
So I was thinking back many years ago looking at those monkeys in the zoo.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,520
And I would always wonder how these monkeys can pick up a banana and open them so quickly.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,200
They break the stem, they pull the stem, they bite the stem, and then they open it up from the

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:34,480
stem side. But a monkey grabs a banana, goes to the other side, squeezes the bottom of the

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,400
banana just like this. Watch this, squeezes it breaks and they pull it just like this.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:51,600
That is beautiful.
